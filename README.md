# cot-4500-as1
The program is to answer the following questions:
1) Use double precision, calculate the resulting values (format to 5 decimal places)
a) 010000000111111010111001
2) Repeat exercise 1 using three-digit chopping arithmetic
3) Repeat exercise 1 using three-digit rounding arithmetic
4) Compute the absolute and relative error with the exact value from question 1 and its 3 digit
rounding

  5 Consider the infinite series: 
  What is the minimum number of terms needed to computer f(1) with error < 10-4?

6) Determine the number of iterations necessary to solve f(x) = x3 + 4x2 â€“ 10 = 0 with
accuracy 10-4 using a = -4 and b = 7.
a) Using the bisection method
b) Using the newton Raphson method
